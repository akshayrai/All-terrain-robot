MJPG INSTALLATION GUIDE:

1.First of all make sure, that your webcam is listed correctly by following command.

lsusb

2.To start you’ve got to install the following packages.

apt-get install libv4l-dev
apt-get install libjpeg8-dev
apt-get install subversion
apt-get install imagemagick

ibv4l-dev and libjpeg8-dev are required dependencies. Subversion and ImageMagick will be needed to get and to compile the code.

3.Now you are ready to download and to compile the code you will need for mjpg streaming.

svn co https://mjpg-streamer.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mjpg-streamer mjpg-streamer
cd mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer
make USE_LIBV4L2=true clean all
make DESTDIR=/usr install

NOTE: In case you are unable to download from the source, manually download from the given URL and then follow the remaining three steps of STEP2.

4.You are now ready to start the mjpg streamer. Using the following line you start a mjpg stream at port 8090 with a resoultion of 320×240 px and 10 frames per second.

mjpg_streamer -i "/usr/lib/input_uvc.so -d /dev/video0  -r 320x240 -f 10" -o "/usr/lib/output_http.so -p 8090 -w /var/www/mjpg_streamer"

5.Input modifiers of mjpg_streamer are:
-d: device
-r: resolution
-f: frame rate
-y specifies YUYV format, rather than MJPEG format if MJPEG ist not supported by your webcam.

Output modifiers are:
-p: port
-w: web serving directory.

6.To display the image stream just add this line to a html-file. You can replace “raspberrypi” with the ip adress of your Raspberry PI.
